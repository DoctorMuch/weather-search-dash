# Placeholder Weather Title
## A searchable weather resource that allows a user to find the current weather and 5-day forecasts for a given location. The app stores user search history for future reference

* Presently, this app uses local storage to populate a search history below the text entry box and submit button.
* The current weather is displayed in a large box to the right of the search form.
* The 5-day forecast populates below the current weather.
- The format is not how I would like to see it. 
- I have avoided using bootstrap, instead trying to format with CSS grid, which is not really the cause of my troubles.
- I hoped to build individual cards for each day of the 5-day forecast, to be displayed side-by-side below the heading of "Five-Day Forecast"
